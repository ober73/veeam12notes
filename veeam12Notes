# Veeam 12 Notes #

Veeam backups put a high load on Object storage, so a proper design is required.

Be careful especially about the size of a bucket, and when possible prefer to use multiple smaller buckets.

For primary backups we found so far that a bucket size of around 250 TB is a good choice, for multiple reasons:

amount of stored objects (and thus metadata)
amount of API calls
throughput


Do not configure any tiering or lifecycle rules on object storage buckets used for Veeam Object Storage Repositories


IMPORTANT

You can not keep backups created by file backup jobs in object storage repositories if they are added as performance extents of the scale-out backup repository.


Use one bucket per scale-out backup repository to reduce metadata. Creating folders for multiple scale-out backup repositories within a bucket slows down processing, as metadata operations within the object storage are handled per bucket.
